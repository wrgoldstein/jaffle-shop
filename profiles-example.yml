# dbt Cloud CLI does not use a profiles.yml file.
# We need one for sqlfluff to run the dbt templater in CI,
# which utilizes dbt-core internally.

your-profile-name:
  target: dev # this is the default if no target is specified
  # since this is just for the linter we'll just have one default dev target
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: # snowflake, bigquery, etc
      account: # if you're going to commit your profile make this an env var like below
      user: #"{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_SANDBOX_USER') }}"
      authenticator: externalbrowser # prefer not using a password, if you do make it an env var
      database: analytics # database to target
      warehouse: transforming # the compute if needed for your platform
      # you can find more about the configs for your platform here:
      # https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/trusted-adapters
      schema: # give this a descriptive name like dbt_your_name
      threads: 8 # generally go as high as your platform will support, this would be fine much higher
